# Chapter 3: Install and Configure Docker on Linux 

Since container technologies were originally designed with the Linux operating system in mind, this chapter will go thru the installation and configuration of Docker on a Linux operating system, with focus on Ubuntu and CentOS. This chapter will also introduce the common commands that SQL Server DBAs need to know when working with a Linux operating system. 

The scripts provided can be used to either manually or automatically install and configure Docker CE on RHEL/CentOS and Ubuntu Linux.
