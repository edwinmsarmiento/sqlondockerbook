Since the goal of the book is to provide a more hands-on experience for the SQL Server DBA, the most common Docker commands will also be covered alongside with exploring the different components. 

The sample code provided are for both Windows Sever (with PowerShell) and Linux. Be sure to run the Docker commands for the appropriate platform.
